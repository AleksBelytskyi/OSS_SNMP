OSS_SNMP - A PHP SNMP library for people who hate SNMP MIBs and OIDs!

See: https://github.com/opensolutions/OSS_SNMP/

This is an example script to show how to use OSS_SNMP. It requires two arguments:

 - the IP address of hostname of a SNMP capable host (with Asterisk SNMP enabled)
 - the SNMP v2 community string for that host

For example:

    {$argv[0]} 192.168.10.20 public


HELPTEXT;

    exit( 1 );
